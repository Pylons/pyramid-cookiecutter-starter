A Cookiecutter (project template) for creating a Pyramid starter project using URL dispatch for routing and either Jinja2, Chameleon, or Mako for templating.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7 or 3.4+
* `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_

Versions
--------

This cookiecutter has several branches to support new features in Pyramid or avoid incompatibilities.

* ``latest`` aligns with the latest stable release of Pyramid, and is the default branch on GitHub.
* ``master`` aligns with the ``master`` branch of Pyramid, and is where development takes place.
* ``x.y-branch`` aligns with the ``x.y-branch`` branch of Pyramid.


Usage
-----

1. Generate a Pyramid project, following the prompts from the command.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ cookiecutter gh:Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-starter

   Optionally append a specific branch checkout to the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ cookiecutter gh:Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-starter --checkout master

2. Finish configuring the project by creating a virtual environment and installing your new project. These steps are output as part of the cookiecutter command above and are slightly different for Windows.

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Change directory into your newly created project.
       $ cd myproj
       # Create a virtual environment...
       $ python3 -m venv env
       # ...where we upgrade packaging tools...
       $ env/bin/pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
       # ...and into which we install our project and its testing requirements.
       $ env/bin/pip install -e ".[testing]"

3. Run your project's tests.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ env/bin/pytest

4. Run your project.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ env/bin/pserve development.ini
